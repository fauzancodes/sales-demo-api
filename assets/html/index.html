        <em>
            <strong>Additional Note:</strong> Don't forget to set SPECIAL_API_KEY in .env to the request header as X-Api-Key or change ENABLE_API_KEY in .env to false or you will not be able to access all endpoints at all. And for those who access the endpoint not through API documentation but from the frontend application, please directly implement the use of the single-use X-Api-Key. The way to create the X-Api-Key is to generate a random string, then calculate the HMAC between the random string and the HMAC_KEY in .env with the SHA-256 algorithm, the result of the HMAC calculation is combined with the random string with the pattern "random_string: hmac_result", then encode the pattern with the Base64 algorithm, the endcode result is the X-Api_key
